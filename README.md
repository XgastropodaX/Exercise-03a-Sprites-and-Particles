# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam - Off the Clock!, April 2022

## Theme
We used the theme of Time Crunch as a way to make clock based enemies and bosses that you beat up to escape the time crunch.

## Game Play
The objective of the game is meant to be to make it to the end of every level, and beat the God of Time to get away from the Time Crunch you're under
Jump, hit, and run through each level and boss to make it through the end!

## Impediments
We ran into a bit of problem where the scenes for Levels 1 and 2 wouldn't open, and we redid the levels and fixed the issue.

## Implementation
Combat, a timer system
